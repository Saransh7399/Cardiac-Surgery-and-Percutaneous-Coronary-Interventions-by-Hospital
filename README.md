## 🏥 Project Overview

This project explores the relationship between hospital experience, location, and patient outcomes, especially concerning cardiac surgeries and percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI).

We leverage machine learning to uncover trends in observed, expected, and risk-adjusted mortality rates, ultimately aiming to assist both patients and healthcare providers in making better-informed decisions.

---

## 💡 Motivation

Our motivation stems from the desire to:

- Understand the efficiency of cardiac surgical vs. non-surgical interventions.
- Help patients make data-driven decisions when selecting hospitals.
- Assist hospitals in identifying improvement areas using predictive analytics.
- Promote healthcare transparency and better patient outcomes.
